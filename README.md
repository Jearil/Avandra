This is a quick sample project for highlighting the usages of [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/) in an android
project. This is a very simple ToDO style application.

You can set up this project in IntelliJ IDEA by importing it from maven. Unit Tests can be run simply by right-clicking
on a test and selecting Run (the regular unit test kind, not the android unit test kind). You can also run the tests
from the command line with `mvn test`.
